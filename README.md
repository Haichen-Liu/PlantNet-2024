# PlantNet-Deep-Plant-Species-Recognition

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, plant species recognition has been widely applied in fields such as agriculture, horticulture, and ecology. In this paper, we selected the Plants Dataset (99 classes) as the foundational dataset for plant species recognition and utilized the ResNet-18 model for experimentation. During the data preprocessing stage, we performed operations such as grayscale conversion, binarization, and denoising on the plant images. To enhance the model's robustness and generalization ability, techniques like cross-validation and data augmentation were employed for model training. The experimental results revealed that grayscale conversion had a significant impact on the model's performance, improving the accuracy and robustness of plant species recognition. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed approach in this paper exhibited significant advancements in plant species recognition. Specifically, the model achieved a recognition accuracy of 96.15% on the test set for identifying five plant species, including aeonium, aloe vera, calendula, mushroom and cactus. This demonstrates both high accuracy and fast identification speed. Consequently, the method proposed in this research holds important application and reference value in the field of plant variety identification and related areas.
